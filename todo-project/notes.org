* todo project

** Desired Features

- [ ] cross out done items
- [ ] hide done items
- [ ] save all items on server

** Technical details
*** To-do object
#+BEGIN_SRC "javascript"
todoOject = {
  text: 'go shopping',
  done: true | false,
}

appSettings = {
  hideDoneItems: true | false,
  useDarkMode: true | false,
}
#+END_SRC

*** Flow
**** Client side
- enter / edit text
- toggle done
- display list
  - respect app settings
- sync list with server
  - on save / edit etc

**** Server side
- read list
- send list
- save list

***** OOP (CLOS) 
- todo object "DTO"
- generic methods for I/O
  - call from http handler


** TODO Tagging
*** TODO UI
- [X] Want to be able to input new ones.
  - [X] Smallish textbox should work.
  - [X] +Needs to auto-generate the "next" textbox to allow for easy multiple entry.+
- [X] Want to be able to select existing ones from a list.
  - [X] Display the last 3 that were used.
  - [X] When typing in the tag input field, display existing ones based on what's typed.
**** TODO Tag rendering
- [X] Line 1: tag entry smallish textbox.
  - [X] Between todo entry and add button.
- [X] Line 2: Selected List.
  - [X] Associate selected tag with todo item.
  - [X] +Is there an ASCII checkmark that can go next to these?+
    - [X] Actually, we just need it for HTML, so use &#10003;
  - [X] +Need an x so we can delete them ... maybe a red x is enough?+
  - [X] Clicking on a selected tag will:
    - [X] remove it from the selected list
    - [X] remove it from association with the todo item
- [-] Line 3: Candidate List - 3 tags.
  - [X] Initially: the last 3 used tags.
  - [-] List changes to:
    - [X] Match the input in the todo field.
    - [ ] Less than 10 matches, fill out with however many of the last 10 are needed.
  - [-] Link to show all tags.
    - [ ] Put right beneath the tag area.
    - [X] +Once a tag is selected, close.+
    - [ ] There will be a close link for the tag area.
**** TODO Filtering
- [X] same basic UI layout - latest 10, input, selected tags
  - [X] When mapping the candidate tag layout, need:
    - [X] A distinct element ID.
    - [X] A different on-click handler.
- [X] put it *above* the existing filter
  - [X] +or maybe to the right of the existing filter?+
- [X] selecting a candidate tag makes a search happen
  - [X] search is conducted against the lookup list of tags and matches are displayed the same way Filter search results are
- [ ] enter a tag updates the list of 10 with matches
- [X] fonts
  - [X] increase 3 to 10
  - [X] make the font smaller
  - [X] keep the words further appart  
*** DONE Persistence
- [X] Tags file in every user folder.
- [X] Have a "lookup file" with todo ID/tag combos?
- [X] Should there be a tag ID?
*** TODO Tags as objects (how the app handles them in memory)
**** DONE Server
- [X] *note* todos are just lists, not CLOS objects.
- [X] I guess for now the representation can match the files.
  - [X] Tags in their own object.
  - [X] The todo/tag ID combos in their own object.
**** TODO Client
- [X] *note* todos are json objects.
- [X] I guess for now the representation can match the files.
- [ ] Render selected list when editing a todo.
  - [ ] For these, the selected tags will display right away since they're already populated.
  - [ ] Layout should be the same - line 1: candidate tags, line 2: add new tag, line 3: selected tags
  - [ ] And need to save any editted associations.
